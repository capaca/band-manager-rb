= README: XSPF for Ruby
This library parses and generates XSPF playlist documents. This is release 0.4.

Current limitations:
    - For 'link', 'meta' and 'extension' elements, only the first one is parsed and only
one can be generated
    - The content of the 'attribution' element is not parsed (the XML content is returned)
    - The content of the 'extension' element is not parsed (the XML content is returned)
